#summary PicKit support library.


There are three classes in this library:

|| *!PicKit2LibUsbTransport* || This encapsulates all the libusb-specific code. Theoretically it would be possible to support a different USB library system by reimplementing this class. ||
|| *!PicKit2* || The main pickit API for executing immediate operations. ||
|| *!PicKit2ScriptBuilder* || The !PicKit firmware actually implements a small virtual machine; this class allows scripts for this VM to be conveniently built. ||
