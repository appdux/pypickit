#summary Elantech touchpad support library.

Currently there is only support for the Elantech eKT8210 touchpad in serial mode.

This touchpad can operate in either serial (9600 8N1) or SPI mode (where the touchpad is an SPI master and generates a clock signal). Serial mode is selected by wiring the SS# and SCLK to ground.
